## âœ… Current Features

- **Test Case Generation**
  - Accepts functional requirements and IDD documents
  - Extracts field-level validation rules
  - Automatically generates positive and negative test cases in JSON format

- **Test Script Generation**
  - Converts test cases into standalone Python `unittest` scripts
  - Maps each test case ID to its corresponding test method
  - Uses HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for validation failure) as assertion basis

- **Test Execution**
  - Executes generated test scripts dynamically
  - Returns structured execution results and error logs via API

- **API Interface**
  - Flask-based backend with endpoints for:
    - `/generateTestScript` â€“ generate Python test code
    - `/executeTestScript` â€“ execute and return result of test code
    - `/api/fund-transfer` â€“ sample test target endpoint
